/**
 * The `Tolgee` class serves as the primary interface for interacting with the Tolgee localization
 * and translation framework. It provides mechanisms for managing languages, locales, and translations
 * in a coroutine-safe and thread-safe manner, ensuring seamless integration of localization features
 * into Kotlin-based applications.
 *
 * This class maintains internal caches and reactive flows for efficient retrieval and updates of
 * translations and locales, prioritizing both performance and flexibility in multilingual environments.
 *
 * Core features include:
 * - Loading and caching of project languages and translations
 * - Locale management with support for reactive updates
 * - On-demand and immediate translation resolution
 *
 * Designed for applications requiring dynamic multilingual support, the `Tolgee` class ensures thread-safe
 * access patterns and handles asynchronous operations efficiently to maintain consistent behavior.
 *
 * Properties:
 * - `config`: Configuration settings for the Tolgee instance.
 *
 * Methods:
 * - `tFlow`: Processes and streams dynamic translations for a given key and parameters.
 * - `t`: Immediately resolves a translation for a given key and parameters.
 * - `preload`: Preloads languages and translations into memory for subsequent use.
 * - `setLocale`: Updates the current locale using various parameter types.
